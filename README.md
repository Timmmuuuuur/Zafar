## üì¶ Making a Call via Curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_SID/Calls.json \
  --data-urlencode "Url=https://your-public-url/voice" \
  --data-urlencode "To=+17472123561" \
  --data-urlencode "From=+15716199102" \
  -u "YOUR_SID:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

## üí° Tips

- Make sure `.mp3` files are under 1MB for fast streaming.
- Use a production-ready deployment like Render, Fly.io, or Heroku if moving beyond Ngrok.
- Memory is session-based (`CallSid`) and short-term. Consider Redis for persistent memory if needed.
